# OOinventory

`Use inheritance in your InventoryTracker project. To do so, create at least five different classes for product 
categories. Each class should set a different value for the "category" field.`

#REQUIREMENTS

`Create at least five classes that extend your existing inventory item class, each one representing a product category. 
(consider why each class needs to be in its own file)`

`Each category class should have a constructor that sets the "category" field to the appropriate name with a literal string.`

`Create a static createItem() method in your main class which returns InventoryItem (or throws an Exception for an invalid category name).`

`Use createItem() to create a new item for option 1. Return one of your subclasses corresponding to the selected category.`

`Use String.format or System.out.printf instead of concatenating strings with +.`

`When you list the items make sure to list their category as well.`
